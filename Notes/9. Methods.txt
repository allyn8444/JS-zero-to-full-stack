- In JavaScript, methods are functions that are associated with objects.
- They are essentially functions that are properties of objects. 
- When a function is a property of an object, it is referred to as a method of that object.
- Methods are invoked on objects and can perform actions or provide information related to the object's state.


So far, I know 3 different ways to declare a method in an Object.

1. Method shorthand:
say() {
    return "This is a say() method";
  }


2. Reference to an External Function:
walk

then declare the function outside the object, like this:
function walk() {
  return "I am walking";
}


3. Traditional Function Expression:
hello: function () {
    console.log("Hello everyone!");
  },



EXAMPLE:

let person = {
  name: "Allyn",
  age: 17,
  working: false,
  subjects: ["Computing", "Programming"],
  // this the say() method
  say() {
    return "This is a say() method";
  },
  // 2nd way of making a method
  walk,
  // 3rd way of making a method
  hello: function () {
    console.log("Hello everyone!");
  },
};

function walk() {
  return "I am walking";
}

// call the methods
console.log(person.say());
console.log(person.walk());
person.hello();
