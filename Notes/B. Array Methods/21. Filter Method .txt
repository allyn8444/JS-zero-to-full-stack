- another built-in array method that is used to create a NEW ARRAY with all elements
     that pass a provided test implemented by a given function

-  It does not modify the original array; instead, it returns a new array containing
     only the elements for which the provided function returns true.



SYNTAX:


const newArray = originalArray.filter( (currentValue, index) => {

  // Return true to include the element in the new array, or false to exclude it

});



- currentValue: The current element being processed in the array.
- index: The index of the current element being processed.



EXAMPLE:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter( (number)= > {
  return number % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]



- As you can see, it only returns the values that agrees in the condition
     aka filtering the values xD


!NOTE: The filter method is useful when you need to extract elements from an array based on a specific condition.




ANOTHER EXAMPLE:

const words = [
  "spray",
  "limit",
  "elite",
  "exuberant",
  "destruction",
  "present",
];

const longWords = words.filter((letters) => {
  return letters.length > 6;
});

console.log(longWords); // Output: [ "exuberant", "destruction", "present" ]
