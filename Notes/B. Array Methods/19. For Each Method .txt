- is a method that is available on arrays.
- It is used to iterate over the elements of an array and execute a provided function once for each array element.
- we pass in an anonymous function (mostly arrow functions are used)
- the function get called one time for every element in th array

- The purpose of forEach is to provide a concise and expressive way to perform an operation on each element
     of an array without the need for a traditional for loop.



SYNTAX:

array.forEach( (currentValue, index) => {
  // Code to be executed for each element
});


-currentValue: The current element being processed in the array.
-index: The index of the current element being processed.




SIMPLE EXAMPLE:

 const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.forEach( (number, index) => {
  console.log(`Element at index ${index} is: ${number}`);
});


OUTPUT:
Element at index 0 is: 1
Element at index 1 is: 2
Element at index 2 is: 3
Element at index 3 is: 4
Element at index 4 is: 5

Example of performing an operation to each element of an array:


const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.forEach((value, index) => {
  value = value * 2;
  console.log(`Element at index ${index} when multiplied by 2 is: ${value}`);
});


output:

Element at index 0 when multiplied by 2 is: 2
Element at index 1 when multiplied by 2 is: 4
Element at index 2 when multiplied by 2 is: 6
Element at index 3 when multiplied by 2 is: 8
Element at index 4 when multiplied by 2 is: 10

You can also do this:


const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let sum = 0;

function adder(number) {
  sum += number;
}
numbers.forEach(adder);

console.log(sum); // output: 15
