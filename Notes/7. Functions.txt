- a function is a block of code that performs a specific task
- function makes a code reusable. You can declare it multiple times.
- function makes your code easier to maintain as it divides the tasks into smaller tasks
- function increases readability
- DRY -> Don't Repeat Yourself


SYNTAX:

function name(parameter){
     // code to be executed
}

-parameters are only optional

In order to make your function functional, you need to call it.
You can call it by:
name()

EXAMPLE:

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello User!");
}

greet(); // Hello User!


NOTE: You can call your function multiple times!



* ========= P A R A M E T E R S - & - A R G U M E N T S ============== *

FUNCTION DECLARATION:

function sayHello(user){
     console.log(`Hello ${user}!`)
}


Calling your function with a parameter is kinda different from without a parameter.
This is how you call your function with a paraneter:

sayHello("Allyn")

-so we passed in data inside our function.
- this is called an "Argument"

output:
Hello Allyn!

* ========= D E F A U L T - P A R A M E T E R S ============== *


Another thing is parameters can have a default value.

function moodToday(mood = "Good") {
  console.log(`I feel ${mood} today.`);
}

- So as you can see, we declared a value in our parameter. That is called the default parameter value
- if user will not pass any argument in our function call, the default parameter value will be used.


moodToday(); // I feel Good today.
moodToday("Bad"); // I feel Bad today.

- The return statement can only be used within function bodies.
- When a return statement is used in a function body, the execution of the function is stopped.
- The return statement has different effects when placed in different functions:
- In a plain function, the call to that function evaluates to the return value.


EXAMPLE:

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

add(1, 2);


- by running the code above, you wont see any output in the console. Why?
- return value are just stored unless you need to use it.
- it is typically stored in a variable for later use.

for example:

let sum = add(1, 2);
console.log(sum); // 3

Function Declaration:

- Defined using the function keyword followed by a function name.
- Can be declared anywhere in the code, as JavaScript hoists function declarations
     to the top of the current scope during the compilation phase.
- The entire function is hoisted, so it can be called before the declaration in the code.
- Can be used for both named and anonymous functions.


Function Expression:

- Defined by assigning a function to a variable using the var, let, or const keyword.
- Must be defined before it is called; otherwise, a reference error will occur.
- Only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the entire function definition.
- Can be used for anonymous functions or named functions (when the function has a name).


Example of Function Declaration:

function say(user){
     console.log(`Hello ${user}`)
}


Example Function Expression:

let greetings = function(user){
     console.log(`Greetings, ${user}!`)
}

Callback functions in JavaScript are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed later;
often after the completion of an asynchronous operation.


This is how you perform a callback function:

function shout(name, callback) {
  console.log(`${name}, this is the main function.`);
  callback();  // <---- as if you are calling a function
}


function iAmCallback() {
  console.log("I am a callback function!");
}

shout("allyn", iAmCallback); // <--- only pass in the function name; dont call it
