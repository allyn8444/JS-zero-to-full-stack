- for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.
- It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more.
- It allows you to iterate directly over the values of the elements, rather than
     dealing with their indexes or keys



SYNTAX:

for (variable of iterable) {
  // code block to be executed
}


variable - For every iteration the value of the next property is assigned to the variable.
          Variable can be declared with const, let, or var.

iterable - An object that has iterable properties.



EXAMPLE:


const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

for (let x of cars) {
  console.log(x);
}

output:
BMW
Volvo
Mini


- as you can see, just need the variable (in our example 'x')
     to access the values.
     Not the same when we use for..in when iterating an array, we need
     to do 'cars[x]' like that.




Another Example in Strings:

let myName = "Ashley";

for (let letter of myName) {
  console.log(letter);
}

output:
A
s
h
l
e
y
