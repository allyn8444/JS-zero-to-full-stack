- A selector in web development refers to a pattern or expression used to identify and
     target one or more HTML elements on a web page.

- Selectors are a fundamental part of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and are also commonly
     used in JavaScript when working with the DOM (Document Object Model).



------------------ IN CSS

- In CSS, selectors are used to apply styles to specific HTML elements.
- Here are some common types of CSS selectors:



1.
Element Selector:
   - Selects HTML elements by their tag name.
  
   ```css
   p {
     color: blue;
   }
   ```



2.
Class Selector:
   - Selects HTML elements by their class attribute.
   - SYNTAX:  .className

   ```css
   .myClass {
     font-size: 16px;
   }
   ```



3.
ID Selector:
   - Selects a single HTML element by its id attribute.
   - SYNTAX:  #idHere

   ```css
   #myId {
     background-color: yellow;
   }
   ```



4.
Attribute Selector:
   - Selects HTML elements based on the presence or value of their attributes.

   ```css
   input[type="text"] {
     border: 1px solid black;
   }
   ```

5.
Combination Selectors:
   - Combines different selectors to create more specific selections.

   ```css
   div.myClass {
     border: 2px solid green;
   }
   ```


----------------- CSS SELECTORS HIERARCHY

- The hierarchy of CSS selectors refers to the specificity and order in which styles are
     applied when multiple selectors target the same element.

-The general rule is that more specific selectors take precedence over less specific ones.

Here's a hierarchy based on specificity:


1. ID
2. Class
3. Elements
4. Attributes







------------------ IN JavaScript

- Selectors play a crucial role not only in styling but also in JavaScript when using methods
     like `document.querySelector` or `document.querySelectorAll` to select and
     manipulate elements in the DOM.

- For example, in JavaScript:



```javascript
// Selects the first paragraph element
const firstParagraph = document.querySelector('p');

// Selects all elements with the class "highlight"
const highlightedElements = document.querySelectorAll('.highlight');
```



- Selectors help developers efficiently target specific elements on a webpage,
- making it possible to apply styles or perform dynamic interactions with those elements.
