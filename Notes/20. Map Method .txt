- method used to create a NEW array by applying a provided function to each element of the original array.
- It doesn't modify the original array but instead returns a new array containing the results of
     applying the provided function to each element.



SYNTAX:

const newArray = originalArray.map( (currentValue, index, array) => {
  // Code to be executed for each element
  // Return the new value for the element
});

(i just prefer arrow functions in methods)

- currentValue: The current element being processed in the array.
- index: The index of the current element being processed.



EXAMPLE:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const squaredNumbers = numbers.map( (number) => {
  return number * number;
});

console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]



If you observed, map() method is kinda the same the forEach() method.
Their process is actually the same, the only difference is that map() method
creates NEW array while forEach() just transforms the current array
