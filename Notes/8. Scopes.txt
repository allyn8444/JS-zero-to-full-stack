- Scope in JS refers to the current context of code,
     which determines the accessibility of variables.

- There are two types of scope in JS; global and local scopes.

- Global Scopes are those declared outside blocks. It has a free scope and are accessible throughout
     the entire program, including within functions.
- Local Scope variables are declared inside blocks, for example inside a function. These kind of
     variables can be only accessed inside the block. Accessing it outside its block will cause an error.


EXAMPLE:

let globalMsg =
  "This is globally because this is free, not inside a function or anything.";

function say() {
  let localMsg = "this is a local message. Local to the say() function";
  console.log(localMsg);

  // you can call any global variables inside a function (local)
  console.log(globalMsg);
}
say();

// since the localMsg variable is local to its function, you can not access it outside the say() function
console.log(localMsg); // This will throw an Error
