- for in statement loops through the properties of an Object.
- is used to iterate over the properties of an object.


SYNTAX:

for (key in object) {
  // code block to be executed
}


variable - For every iteration the value of the next property is assigned to the variable.
          Variable can be declared with const, let, or var.

iterable - An object that has iterable properties.




EXAMPLE:

const person = { fname: "John", lname: "Doe", age: 25 };

for (let x in person) {
  console.log(person[x]);
}

output:
John
Doe
25


- the variable acts as the 'key' in our object enabling us to access its properties


EXPLAINED:

- The for in loop iterates over a person object
- Each iteration returns a key (x)
- The key is used to access the value of the key
- The value of the key is person[x]


!NOTE: for.. in can be also used for arrays but it is a bad practice since arrays has its own for..of loop
